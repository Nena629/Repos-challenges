                                        When Mary’s parents die of cholera in India, she is sent to England to live with her uncle. Instructed by the housekeeper
                                        not to “poke about the house,” she spends her time out of doors. There, she makes friends with a stray dog, who one days 
                                        leads her to a secret garden. Through her dog, Mary also meets Dicken, a boy from the moors. Together, they work to restore 
                                        the garden to its former beauty.

                                        One night, as Mary hears cries from another part of the house, she ventures out of her room and discoverers her cousin Colin.
                                        Confined to his bed by his fears of dying young or growing a hunchback like his father, Colin bosses Mary around as he’s always 
                                        bossed the servants around.
